        <h3>1. How do I know if my money was actually put to towards the use that was listed?</h3>
        <p> We keep our donors informed by requiring that Charity organizations follow up with their donors and give them details about how the money helped their cause.</p>

        </br></br>

        <h3>2. What if I don’t have $25 to donate, but still want to help out?</h3>
        <p>No problem! Send us a message through our <a href="#">contact form</a>. We’d love to discuss other ways you can still give back. Our Charity organizations are very accommodating and open to new ideas!</p>

        </br></br>

         <h3>3. What if I want to donate to a Charity, but not to one of the people or programs that are listed on this site?</h3>
         <p>Send us a message here and we can reach out to the Charity organization for you or help point you in the right direction so you can reach out to them yourself.</p>


        </br></br>

        <h3>4. What if I’m looking for donations myself, how do I set up an account?</h3>
        <p>If you have a fundraising goal and would like our help, you must first contact us or a specific Charity organization in order to apply for an account. Charity Organizations approve all of the personal profiles and program donation accounts.</p>

      </br></br>

      <h3>5. I have another great idea! How do I get involved with TransparenC?</h3>
      <p>Send us a message! We’d love to chat. We’re open to new ideas and constantly looking for ways to improve our site and ways to give back to our community. </p>
